  abstract           = {Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have gained widespread attention in recent years as a potentially new and crucial layer of biological regulation. lncRNAs of all kinds have been implicated in a range of developmental processes and diseases, but knowledge of the mechanisms by which they act is still surprisingly limited, and claims that almost the entirety of the mammalian genome is transcribed into functional noncoding transcripts remain controversial. At the same time, a small number of well-studied lncRNAs have given us important clues about the biology of these molecules, and a few key functional and mechanistic themes have begun to emerge, although the robustness of these models and classification schemes remains to be seen. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of the lncRNA field, discussing what is known about the genomic contexts, biological functions, and mechanisms of action of lncRNAs. We also reflect on how the recent interest in lncRNAs is deeply rooted in biologyâ€™s longstanding concern with the evolution and function of genomes.},

They protect genomes from foreign nucleic acids. They can guide DNA synthesis or genome rearrangement. For ribozymes and riboswitches, the RNA structure itself provides the biological function, but most ncRNAs operate as RNA-protein complexes, including ribosomes, snRNPs, snoRNPs, telomerase, microRNAs, and long ncRNAs. Many, though not all, ncRNAs exploit the power of base pairing to selectively bind and act on other nucleic acids. Here, we describe the pathway of ncRNA research, where every established "rule" seems destined to be overturned.},

We have now analyzed the entire mouse Xist gene. The mature inactive X-specific transcript is 15 kb in length and contains no conserved ORF. The Xist sequence contains a number of regions comprised of tandem repeats. Comparison with the human XIST gene demonstrates significant conservation of sequence and gene structure. Xist RNA is not associated with the translational machinery of the cell and is located almost exclusively in the nucleus. Together with conservation of inactive X-specific expression, these findings support a role for Xist in X inactivation, possibly as a functional RNA or as a chromatin organizer region.},

A restriction fragment of the rDNA containing the IVS and portions of the adjacent rRNA sequences (exons) was inserted downstream from the lac UV5 promoter in a recombinant plasmid. Transcription of this template by purified Escherichia coli RNA polymerase in vitro produced a shortened version of the pre-rRNA, which was then deproteinized. When incubated with monovalent and divalent cations and a guanosine factor, this RNA underwent splicing. The reactions that were characterized included the precise excision of the IVS, attachment of guanosine to the 5' end of the IVS, covalent cyclization of the IVS and ligation of the exons. We conclude that splicing activity is intrinsic to the structure of the RNA, and that enzymes, small nuclear RNAs and folding of the pre-rRNA into an RNP are unnecessary for these reactions. We propose that the IVS portion of the RNA has several enzyme-like properties that enable it to break and reform phosphodiester bonds. The finding of autocatalytic rearrangements of RNA molecules has implications for the mechanism and the evolution of other reactions that involve RNA.},

As a means of assessing which of the 35 small open reading frames might be important to the function of the gene, the human H19 gene was cloned and sequenced. Comparison of the two homologs revealed no conserved open reading frame. Cellular fractionation showed that H19 RNA is cytoplasmic but not associated with the translational machinery. Instead, it is located in a particle with a sedimentation coefficient of approximately 28S. Despite the fact that it is transcribed by RNA polymerase II and is spliced and polyadenylated, we suggest that the H19 RNA is not a classical mRNA. Instead, the product of this unusual gene may be an RNA molecule.},

Here we show that inactivation of genes related to RNAi pathway genes, a homolog of Drosophila Dicer (dcr-1), and two homologs of rde-1 (alg-1 and alg-2), cause heterochronic phenotypes similar to lin-4 and let-7 mutations. Further we show that dcr-1, alg-1, and alg-2 are necessary for the maturation and activity of the lin-4 and let-7 stRNAs.

Moreover, the overwhelming majority of variants, both somatic and germline, occur in non-coding portions of the genome. We review the current understanding of non-coding variants in cancer, including the great diversity of the mutation types--from single nucleotide variants to large genomic rearrangements--and the wide range of mechanisms by which they affect gene expression to promote tumorigenesis, such as disrupting transcription factor-binding sites or functions of non-coding RNAs.
